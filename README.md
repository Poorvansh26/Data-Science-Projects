Overview

 This repository contains code and resources for a data science project aimed at detecting Parkinson's Disease using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset containing various features extracted from biomedical voice measurements of individuals with and without Parkinson's Disease. The goal is to build a predictive model capable of accurately identifying the presence of Parkinson's Disease based on these features.

 Dataset
 
The dataset used in this project consists of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). Each column in the table is a particular voice measure, and each row corresponds to one of 195 voice recordings from these individuals ("name" column). The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to the "status" column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD. 
The Dataset can be obtained from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/parkinsons-disease-data-set".

This project is done using Google collab and the original file can be found on 'https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1b9Q0rnCmeCEXu0l_KtdbkNM8w_am4LqC'.
